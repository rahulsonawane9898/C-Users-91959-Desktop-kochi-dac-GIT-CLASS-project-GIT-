Abstract
HOSPITAL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
The goal of the project "HOSPITAL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM" is to computerise the hospital's front 
office management and produce software that is user-friendly, quick, and cost-effective. It is 
concerned with the gathering of patient information, diagnosis data, and so on. Previously, it was 
done by hand. The system's principal job is to register and maintain patient and doctor information, 
as well as to access and meaningfully change this information as needed. Patient information and 
diagnosis information are entered into the system, and the system output is used to display these 
details on the screen. A username and password are required to access the Hospital Management 
System. It can be accessed by a receptionist or an administrator. They are the only ones who have 
access to the database. The information is easily accessible. The data is well-protected for personal 
use, and the processing of the data is very quick.
